    "- By geo location: in theory, this is very precise. The Swiss federal geo portal, https://www.geo.admin.ch/, offers \"swissBOUNDARIES3D municipal boundaries constitute the administrative borders of the municipalities of Switzerland\". They offer web services to access their data at https://api3.geo.admin.ch/index.html which seem well documented (but rather extensive). \n"
