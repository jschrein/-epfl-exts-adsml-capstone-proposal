    "# Political Parties in Switzerland\n",
    "\n",
    "In the capstone project I am using the voter shares of political parties in the Swiss federal parliament elections (\"Nationalsratswahlen\") of 2019. The \"regional portraits \" data set contains the election results for each party in each of the 2202 communes. Later on I will introduce a way to aggregate multiple parties' voter shares to a single indicator variable for the political orientation on a left-right scale. But first I will present a summary of the parties profiles. Here, they are ordered by their voter shares on the national level.\n",

    "# The left-right political spectrum\n",
    "Assigning political positions on a one-dimensional axis that ranges from left to right is obviously a huge simplification. Still, since it was established around the time of the French Revolution, where in the assembly the royalists were sitting on the right side and the republicans were sitting on the left, it has become ubiquitous in the media and political conversation. Everybody seems to intuitively be able to tell if \"lowering taxes\" or \"allowing more immigration\" are right or left positions. Since this is not a political science seminar, I do not delve deeper into the subject. I assume that it is possible to locate the Swiss political parties on a left-right axis so that their relative positions are consistent with their programs and the perception of the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed spectrum for the project\n",
    "I will use an axis that uses integral values from -2 (very left) to +2 (very right) and assign the parties like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| -2 | -1 | 0 | +1 | +2 |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "|GPS|SP |CVP|FDP|SVP|\n",
    "|PdA| -  |GLP|BDP|RW*|\n",
    "| - | -  |EVP| - | - |\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* RW = right-wing parties that are only summarized in the \"regional portraits\" data set. They have a 2% overall vote share.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will name the position of a party on that axis the left-right value (short lr-value) of the party. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculation of political orientation value\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of an election is measured by the number of votes that each party gets. Then the vote share is calculated as the ratio of the party's votes to all votes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given an election, I propose to use the weighted (by vote share) average of left-right values of the parties as an indicator of where on the left-right political spectrum an election result as a whole can be assigned. I will name this weighted average the \"political orientation value\" (short po-value).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{po} = \\frac{\\sum \\limits _{p \\in P} lr_p \\cdot vs_p}{\\sum \\limits _{p \\in P} vs_p}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\bar{po}$ political orientation value  \n",
    "$P$ set of all parties  \n",
    "$lr_p$ left-right value of party p  \n",
    "$vs_p$ vote share of party p  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have to divide by the sum of all vote shares because they don't usually add up to exactly 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The political orientation value can be calculated at various levels, e.g.\n",
    "- for the overall result of the Swiss national parliament elections of 2019\n",
    "- seperately for each of the Swiss communes where people voted in these elections\n",
    "- in analogy, you can also compute the po-value for the parliament itself, using the number of representatives of each party instead of the election vote count\n",
    "- or even for the national government, where each of the 7 members belongs to one of the parties\n",
    "\n",
    "The political orientation value is a meaningful value, it can be used to derive statements like:\n",
    "- in the 2019 national elections, the parliament moved to the left compared to 2015\n",
    "- larger cities tend to be more politcal left than small rural communes\n",
    "- the national government's composition is more to the right than the parliament\n",
    "\n",
    "In the capstone project, I will use the po-values of the Swiss communes as the independent variable and try to predict it using various features of the communes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Political polarization\n",
    "\n",
    "While the po-value as an average gives important information about an electorate or an assembly, it does not convey the complete picture. There is also the aspect of political polarization. Basically that means: in a very polarized environment, most votes go the parties at the extreme ends of the spectrum, while the center parties have a low share of votes. In another, less polarized environment, most votes go to center parties. Still both environments could have similar po-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify the political polarization, one can use the weighted (by vote share) standard deviation of the of left-right values of the parties, using the po-value from above as the weighted mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac {\\sum \\limits _{p \\in P} (lr_p - \\bar{po})^2 vs_p} {\\sum \\limits _{p \\in P} vs_p}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma$ weighted standard deviation, represents political polarization  \n",
    "$P$ set of all parties  \n",
    "$lr_p$ left-right value of party p  \n",
    "$\\bar{po}$ weighted mean, represents political orientation  \n",
    "$vs_p$ vote share of party p  \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- highly polarized, 50% at +/-2: $\\bar{po}$ = 0, $\\sigma$ = 2\n",
    "- flat, 20% at each lr-value: $\\bar{po}$ = 0, $\\sigma$ = 1.4\n",
    "- centric, 10% at +/-2, 20% at +/-1, 40% at 0: $\\bar{po}$ = 0, $\\sigma$ = 1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "The political polarization is certainly a meaningful value. High polarization is generally not considered to be a good thing for society. Fortunately, in Switzerland (in the 2019 data set we use), mean polarization is 1.3 and 95th percentil is 1.55.\n",
    "\n",
    "The political polarization will not be used in the capstone project, because it is better to concentrate on one thing at a time, and because the above numbers show that polarization is only benign in Switzerland."
